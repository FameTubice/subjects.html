			<tr>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: green;">Biology</td>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: green;">Because it fascinates you with the complexity of life, helps you understand how living organisms interact with their environment, and inspires a sense of wonder about the intricate systems that sustain life on Earth.</td>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: green;">I classify Biology as green because greem is the color of the leaves of trees, I immediately think about green.</td>

			<tr>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: white;">Values Education</td>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: white;">Because Values Education is talking about the behavior and it's not graded</td>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: white;">In Values Education, the color white stands for purity, peace, and the pursuit of truth and moral integrity.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: blue;">Health</td>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: blue;">I like learning about health is fun because it empowers us to understand and care for our bodies, promotes well-being, and provides practical knowledge that leads to a better, more active life.</td>
				<td style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: blue;">Blue because it represents calmness, stability, and tranquility, which are vital for mental well-being, while also symbolizing clean water and airâ€”key elements of physical health.</td>
